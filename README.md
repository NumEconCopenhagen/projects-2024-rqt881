This repository contains  
1. **Inaugural project**: Explores an exchange economy with two consumers and two goods, investigating utility maximization and resource allocation.
The results can be seen by running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
2. **Data project**: I fetch data via the Yahoo Finance API and constructing efficient portfolios under conditions of estimation uncertainty. Additionally employing simulations I examine how different sample sizes can influence the accuracy and stability of the efficient frontier.
The results can be seen by running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).
3. **Model project**: The project, titled Black-Scholes Model Analysis, delves into the pricing of options. It begins by exploring the analytical solution provided by the Black-Scholes model, then transitions to a numerical approach using the binomial tree method. As an extension for further research, the analysis looks at American options.
The results can be seen by running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).
4. **Exam project**: This project involves solving various economic modeling problems, including optimal taxation and government consumption, career choice optimization, and function approximation using barycentric interpolation. 
The results can be seen by running [examproject.ipynb](examproject.ipynb).
