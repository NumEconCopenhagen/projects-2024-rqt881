This repository contains  
1. *Inaugural project*. 
2. *Data project*: I fetch data via the Yahoo Finance API and constructing efficient portfolios under conditions of estimation uncertainty. Additionally employing simulations I examine how different sample sizes can influence the accuracy and stability of the efficient frontier.
3. *Model project*: The project, titled Black-Scholes Model Analysis, delves into the pricing of options. It begins by exploring the analytical solution provided by the Black-Scholes model, then transitions to a numerical approach using the binomial tree method. As an extension for further research, the analysis looks at American options.
4. *Examproject*:
