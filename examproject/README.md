### Exam Project

The exam project consists of three problems, each with multiple questions:

1. **Problem 1: Production Economy and CO2 Taxation**
   - Analyze optimal firm behavior in labor demand, output, and profits.
   - Study consumer behavior to maximize utility given labor supply and taxation.
   - Check market clearing conditions to identify equilibrium prices.
   - Determine the optimal tax rate to maximize social welfare considering environmental impact.

2. **Problem 2: Career Choice Model**
   - Simulate expected and realized utility for different career choices.
   - Analyze the impact of friends' information on career decisions.
   - Recalculate optimal career choices after learning job utility and accounting for switching costs.

3. **Problem 3: Barycentric Interpolation**
   - Use barycentric coordinates to approximate function values within a unit square.
   - Compare approximated values with true function values to evaluate interpolation accuracy.
